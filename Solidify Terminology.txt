## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:
1) What is HTTP?: 
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it's how browsers and servers communicate.

2) What is a URL?: 
A URL is the address of a given website. It contains multiple parts including a protocol and hostname.

3) What is DNS?: 
DNS (Domain Name System) acts like a phone book for the web. It takes in a readable hostname and converts it to the corresponding IP address.

4) What is a query string?: 
A query string provides extra information (search terms, form info, etc.)

5) What are the two HTTP verbs and how are they different?: 
The two HTTP verbs are GET and POST. These are both used to transfer data. GET requests information as part of the URL and does not modify 
or change server data. POST requests are arguments sent as the body of the request and will change data on the server.

6) What is an HTTP request?: 
An HTTP request is a request made to a hostname on a server using the HTTP protocol.

7) What is an HTTP response?: 
An HTTP response is a response from a server with the information needed to generate a webpage in a browser.

8) What is an HTTP header? Give a couple of examples of request and response headers you have seen: 
An HTTP header contains information about a particular request or response. Some examples include hostname, date/time, cookies, and caching information.

9) What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? 
First, DNS resolves the hostname into a specific IP address. 
The browser makes a GET request to that IP address (includes headers). 
The server sends a response back containing headers and the HTML text for that page. 
The HTML (including CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) is then rendered by the browser.
